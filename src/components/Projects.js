        I’m currently building my skills in web development and cybersecurity. While I don’t have major public projects yet, here are a few things I’ve worked on and learned from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🛠 Built this portfolio website using React and React Router</li>
        <li>💻 Completed C++ programming assignments in CMPT 125/135 that focused on logic, functions, and data structures</li>
        <li>🔐 Learned Linux and Bash scripting basics through my cybersecurity coursework</li>
        <li>🧠 Practiced using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build basic layouts and interactions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm excited to apply these skills in real-world projects and expand my portfolio over time.
      </p>
