      <p>
        Hey! I'm Chance Wijewardena, a Computer Science student with a deep interest in cybersecurity and technology that makes a real-world impact. I enjoy learning about systems, solving technical problems, and exploring how secure, ethical computing can improve our lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of academics, I'm a huge fan of the outdoors! I go hiking almost every week to reset and recharge. Whether it’s local trails or mountain peaks, hiking helps me stay grounded and focused.
      </p>

        When I'm not at school, I'm either working or spending time with friends and family. One of my favorite family traditions is traveling. Two years ago, I crossed a big item off my bucket list by driving to the Arctic Circle and witnessing the northern lights which is an experience I’ll never forget.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether I’m on the trail or diving into code, I’m always excited to learn, connect, and build.
